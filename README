sudox is a POSIX shell script which acts as a wrapper for
sudo -Hs with passing X authority data to the client.

It is possible to create temporary untrusted X permissions.
Also some support for screen and tmux is provided.

For more details, see the output of sudox -h

For installation, copy sudox with executable permission in your path.
To obtain support for zsh completion, you can copy _sudox to a
directory of zsh's $fpath

You also need push.sh from http://github.com/vaeth/push in your path.

For Gentoo, there is an ebuild in the mv overlay (available by layman).
